# Excel VBA

Excel VBA were developed to loop through multiple years of stock data and by ticker symbol and date to grab the stocks that changed the most and the least year over year. The yearly change for each row was calculated using a "for-loop" in VBA and conditioanl formatting was applied with green having the most positive change and red having the most negative change.

Lastly a summary was created to highlight which ticker had the greatest increase and which one had the biggest drop and which one had the highest volume for the year. This was done using built in v-lookup functionality in Excel through VBA. The loop runs through each sheet and lists each max per letter alphabetically.
